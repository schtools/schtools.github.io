    <p align=center>Welcome to SchTools! Here you will find tools built for Contentkeeper systems.</p>
    <p align=center>Web design is not my strongsuit so excuse the poor visuals of the site.</p>

      <h3>Website Unblocker Tool</h3>
      <!--<p>This is a program (Windows only) that essentially "unblocks" a site assuming you have a Contentkeeper Appliance on your network</p>
      <p>You can download the program <a href="https://github.com/schtools/ck-site-unblocker">here</a>. Make sure to read the instructions on the Github page first.</p>-->
      <p>This is still in development, check the progress out on the readme of the github repo <a href="https://github.com/schtools/ck-site-unblocker">here</a></p>
      <h3>Online Unblocker Tool</h3>
      <p>This is a modification of the window that would normally show up when you would try to access an unclassified site. <br>This version allows you to change the URL you want to unblock and the URL of the Contentkeeper Appliance.</p>
      <p>You can use it <a href="reclassify-site.html">Here</a>.</p>

      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>The inspiration for the tools I have made is simply because I became annoyed that my institution had blocked some useful resources such as <a href="https://web.archive.org/">The Wayback Machine</a>.<br>I have decided to make this website to share these tools with the world for others that may have even stricter content blockers.<br>These tools were developed for a Contentkeeper system that is only installed on the network. These tools may not work for everyone or every site.</p>
      <p>I am not responsible for any trouble I may get anyone into if they choose to use these tools, this is on you pal. Furthermore these tools are for educational use only, don't use them maliciously!!!</p>
      <p>Also if you would like to hire me Contentkeeper, that would be really funny please do!</p>
